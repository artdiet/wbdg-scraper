## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Strategy**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `feature/*`: New features
   - `bugfix/*`: Bug fixes
   - `release/*`: Release preparation

2. **Code Review Process**
   - Pull request reviews
   - Foundry transform testing
   - Documentation updates
   - Foundry dataset validation

3. **Release Process**
   - Version tagging

   - Additional transformation formats
   - Performance optimizations
   - Foundry-specific optimizations
   - **Unit tests for transforms (now implemented)**

2. **Technical Debt**
   - Code documentation
   - Test coverage
   - Build optimization
   - Foundry resource optimization

## Maintenance

1. **Regular Tasks**
   - Dependency updates
   - Security patches
   - Performance monitoring
   - Foundry resource monitoring

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - User guides
   - Development guides

## Build Status

- The `project-setup` branch build is confirmed successful as of 15 May 2025.

## Project Refactoring Note

- This project was refactored and modernized using Cursor on 15 May 2025. The refactor included improved error handling, robust documentation, and the addition of automated unit tests and build checks in Palantir Foundry.
