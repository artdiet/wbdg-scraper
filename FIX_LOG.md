   - Configurable retry attempts and delays
   - Detailed error logging with retry counts

2. Enhanced progress tracking
   - Added tqdm progress bars
   - Improved logging with file sizes and checksums
   - Better status tracking for each stage

3. Added PDF validation
   - Implemented using PyPDF2
   - File size checks before download
   - Checksum verification
   - Chunked downloading for large files

4. Improved resource management
   - Configurable chunk size
   - Maximum file size limit
   - Better memory management
   - More efficient error handling

**Impact:**
- More reliable PDF downloads
- Better error visibility
- Improved resource usage
- Enhanced validation

**Prevention:**
- Regular monitoring of error logs
- Periodic validation of downloaded files
- Resource usage monitoring
- Regular dependency updates
