# Cursor Session Log

**Date:** 15 May 2025
**Branch:** feature/project-setup

---

## Summary
This session documents the collaborative refactor and modernization of the WBDG Downloader project using Cursor. The project was updated for robust error handling, improved documentation, and automated unit tests and build checks in Palantir Foundry.

---

## Major Actions & Decisions

- **Refactored main transform (`wbdg-transform.py`)** for better error handling, retry logic, and Foundry compatibility.
- **Updated `connectionTest.py`** to use robust connection and error handling for quick, lightweight connectivity checks.
- **Added and managed dependencies** (`tqdm`, `tenacity`, `pypdf2`) via Foundry's package installer and `meta.yml`.
- **Created and pushed unit tests** for `connectionTest.py` in `transforms-python/src/test/`, using Foundry's PyTest-based test runner.
- **Updated documentation**: `README.md`, `PROJECT_OUTLINE.md`, `CURSOR_OUTLINE.md`, and `FIX_LOG.md` to reflect the new workflow, testing, and build status.
- **Confirmed successful build** of the `feature/project-setup` branch in Foundry, with automated checks and tests passing.

---

## Testing & Build Status
- Unit tests for connection logic are now run automatically during Foundry build checks.
- The current build is successful and all checks have passed.
- Future plans include expanding unit tests to cover more transforms and outputs.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue to add and refine unit tests for other transforms and data outputs.
- Use `connectionTest.py` for quick connectivity checks before running full transforms.
- Keep documentation up to date for both human reviewers and AIP Assist.
- Use this log as a reference for future Cursor sessions or onboarding new contributors.
